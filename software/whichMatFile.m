function [ fullFileName ] = whichMatFile( filename )
%whichMatFile Finds the location of the filename on the path

% The function first searches in the current working directory (quick). If
% this fails, then it uses matfile to locate the file.
% 
% INPUT
% filename is an absolute or relative path for matfile
%
% OUTPUT
% fullFileName is the full file name of the file that would be loaded by
% the builtin load function
%
