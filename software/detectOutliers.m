%       k           : Roughly, for a certain value of k, observations
%                     that are k*sigma away from the mean will be

%                     Optional. Default: 3.
%OUTPUT outlierIdx  : Index of observations that are considered outliers.
%       inlierIdx   : Index of observations that are considered inliers.

%% outlier detection

%calculate median of observations
medObs = nanmedian(observations(:));

%get residuals, i.e. distance of observations from median
residuals = observations(:) - medObs;

%square the residuals
res2 = residuals .^ 2;

%calculate the median of the squared residuals
medRes2 = max(nanmedian(res2),eps);

%define parameter to remove outliers (see Rousseeuw 1987, p. 202)
magicNumber2 = 1/norminv(.75)^2;

%calculate test-statistic values
testValue = res2 / (magicNumber2 * medRes2);

%determine which observations are inliers and which are outliers
inlierIdx = find(testValue <= k^2);
outlierIdx = find(testValue > k^2);

%Make sure these damn things are row vectors - somehow it returns them
%differently with different input
inlierIdx = inlierIdx(:)';
outlierIdx = outlierIdx(:)';
