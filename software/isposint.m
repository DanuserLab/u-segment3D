function isit = isposint(in)
%ISPOSINT returns true if all elements of the input are positive integers
%
% tf = isposint(in)
%
% This function duplicates the functionality of isposintscalar and
% isposintmat, but those functions are in the system identification
% toolbox, so this avoids having your code depend on that toolbox.
